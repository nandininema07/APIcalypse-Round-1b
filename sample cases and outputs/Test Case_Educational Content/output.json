CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 1.1 Historical Background of Organic Chemistry Organic chemistry is the area of chemistry that involves the study of carbon and its compounds. In theory (Oparin, 1923) organic chemistry may have its beginnings with the big bang when the components of ammonia, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and methane combined to form amino acids, an experiment that has been verified in the laboratory (Miller, 1950). His discovery meant that the natural \"vital force\" was not required to synthesis organic compounds, and paved the way for many chemists to synthesize organic compounds. In the 16th century organic compounds were isolated from nature in the pure state (Scheele, 1769) and analytical methods were developed for determination of elemental composition (Lavoisier, 1784).",

In this process the leaving group departs because of the substrate structure and its interaction with the solvent to form an intermediate called a carbocation. Most solvents are polar to interact with the ionic leaving group and to stabilize the polar carbocation intermediate. This leaves out methyl and primary substrates as their cations are just too high energy, unless there is some adjacent stabilizing group (such as phenyl or CH3O).",
